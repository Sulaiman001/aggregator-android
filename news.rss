      <title>Aggregator Howto Â» Entry Rules</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[
          <p>
            <b>Aggregator</b> uses user-defined entry rules to filter out the entries
            of a feed.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two types of rules: <b>exclude rules</b>, used to mark which
            entries should be hidden while aggregating a feed, and
            <b>include rules</b>, used to cancel the effect of some exclude rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every entry rule defines a <b>mask</b> used to match the entries for which
            the rule <b>action</b> is applied. The <i class="marked">%</i> character
            is used to match zero, one or multiple characters, and can be used
            multiple times in a <b>mask</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the <i class="marked">%aggregator%</i> title mask will match
            every entry that contains <i class="marked">aggregator</i> in the title.
            While the <i class="marked">% Vol % Ch %</i> title mask will match every
            entry that contains both <i class="marked">&nbsp;Vol&nbsp;</i> and
            <i class="marked">&nbsp;Ch&nbsp;</i> (in the same order as present in the
             mask) in the title.
          </p>
          <h2>Excluding unwished entries</h2>
          <p>
            The easyest way to define rules that hide entries of a feed is by using
            the <b>exclude</b> action:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Select the entry which you want to exclude by <i>long pressing</i> it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Click the <i>exclude</i> action from the action bar.<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>
              NOTE: Depending on your device type, the <b>exclude</b> action can be
              found either as as an action icon or as an option in the overflow menu.
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>
              HINT: Long pressing an icon in the action bar reveals the action name.
            </i>
          </p>
          <h2>Excluding all entries except the whished ones</h2>
          <p>
            This is achieved by defining at least two rules:
            <ol>
              <li>
                An <b>exclude</b> rule that hides every entry by using the following
                title mask: <i class="marked">%</i>
              </li>
              <li>
                One or more <b>include</b> rules that will cancel the effect of the
                <b>exclude</b> rule.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            These rules are preferably created from the <i>entry rules</i> activity,
            which can be opened by clicking the <b>entry rules</b> option from the
            overflow menu.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>
              NOTE: The <b>entry rules</b> activity lists all the rules of a feed,
              including the global ones, while also showing how many entries are
              matched by a rule.
            </i>
