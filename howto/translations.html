    <h1>Translating Aggregator</h1>
    <p><img alt="installs by user" src="https://tughi.github.io/aggregator-android/howto/translations.png" /></p>
<p>Looking at Google's statistic, I thought that there might be some users out there that would
like to contribute by translating the app. So I set up a <a href="https://weblate.tughi.com">website</a>
that would allow just that.</p>
<p>In the past days I looked at more self-hostable solutions and decided to go on with <a href="https://weblate.org">Weblate</a>. In this post I am not going to explain how to use Weblate since this is
alreay covered by their <a href="https://docs.weblate.org/en/weblate-2.12/user/translating.html">documentation</a>
but go over what means to translate Aggregator.</p>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>Registration is open. You only need a Google account to be able to sign in.</p>
<p>This account will be used for e-mail notifications, if enabled.</p>
<h3>Initial configuration</h3>
<p>On your first login, please go to the <a href="https://weblate.tughi.com/accounts/profile/#account">profile page</a>
and set the <code>Full name</code>. The username and the full name is the only information visible to other
translators... you can configure both of them.</p>
<p>Next, please go to <a href="https://weblate.tughi.com/accounts/profile/#languages">Languages</a> and select
your language(s) in the <code>Translated languages</code> field.</p>
<p>Now move to <a href="https://weblate.tughi.com/accounts/profile/#subscriptions">Subscriptions</a> and select
<strong>Aggregator</strong> as a <code>watched project</code>.</p>
<p>By completing these two steps, the Weblate dashboard will give you direct links to the languages
you can translate.</p>
<p>To stay informed about <code>new strings to translate</code>, <code>new suggestions</code> or <code>new comments</code> activate
them in the subscription settings (this section is not visible in the mobile version of the website).</p>
<h3>The translation process</h3>
<p>Translators are able to suggest new translations or vote suggestions from other translators. A
suggestion is applied as soon as it receives <strong>3</strong> votes.</p>
<p>If some strings cannot be translated just by looking at the string and context, please add a
comment and I'll try to give more details.</p>
<p>Strings can contain special markers like <code>%1$s</code> or <code>%2$d</code>... Please keep them in the translated
text. They are required at runtime when the final text is generated.</p>
<p>Only the languages that are over 90% completed are added to Aggregator... gowing below this
percentage means removal too.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 164 strings (totaling 433 words) used in different parts of the app. Not that many... Right?</p>
