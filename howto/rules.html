    <h1>Entry rules</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Aggregator</b> uses user-defined entry rules to filter out the entries
      of a feed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two types of rules: <b>exclude rules</b>, used to mark which
      entries should be hidden while aggregating a feed, and
      <b>include rules</b>, used to cancel the effect of some exclude rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every entry rule defines a <b>mask</b> used to match the entries for which
      the rule <b>action</b> is applied. The <i class="marked">%</i> character
      is used to match zero, one or multiple characters, and can be used
      multiple times in a <b>mask</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the <i class="marked">%aggregator%</i> title mask will match
      every entry that contains <i class="marked">aggregator</i> in the title.
      While the <i class="marked">% Vol % Ch %</i> title mask will match every
      entry that contains both <i class="marked">&nbsp;Vol&nbsp;</i> and
      <i class="marked">&nbsp;Ch&nbsp;</i> (in the same order as present in the
       mask) in the title.
    </p>
    <h2>Excluding unwished entries</h2>
    <p>
      The easyest way to define rules that hide entries of a feed is by using
      the <b>exclude</b> action:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Select the entry which you want to exclude by <i>long pressing</i> it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click the <i>exclude</i> action from the action bar.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        NOTE: Depending on your device type, the <b>exclude</b> action can be
        found either as as an action icon or as an option in the overflow menu.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        HINT: Long pressing an icon in the action bar reveals the action name.
      </i>
    </p>
    <h2>Excluding all entries except the whished ones</h2>
    <p>
      This is achieved by defining at least two rules:
      <ol>
        <li>
          An <b>exclude</b> rule that hides every entry by using the following
          title mask: <i class="marked">%</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          One or more <b>include</b> rules that will cancel the effect of the
          <b>exclude</b> rule.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      These rules are preferably created from the <i>entry rules</i> activity,
      which can be opened by clicking the <b>entry rules</b> option from the
      overflow menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        NOTE: The <b>entry rules</b> activity lists all the rules of a feed,
        including the global ones, while also showing how many entries are
        matched by a rule.
