    <h1>Entry rules</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Aggregator</b> uses entry rules to filter out the entries of a feed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two types of rules: <b>exclude rules</b>, used to mark which entries
      should be hidden while aggregating a feed, and <b>include rules</b>, used to
      cancel the effect of some exclude rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every entry rule defines a <b>mask</b> used to match the entries for which
      the rule <b>action</b> is applied. The <i class="marked">%</i> character
      is used to match zero, one or multiple characters, and can be used multiple
      times in a <b>mask</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the <i class="marked">%aggregator%</i> title mask will match
      every entry that contains <i class="marked">aggregator</i> in the title.
      While the <i class="marked">% Vol % Ch %</i> title mask will match every
      entry that contains both <i class="marked">&nbsp;Vol&nbsp;</i> and
      <i class="marked">&nbsp;Ch&nbsp;</i> (in the same order as present in the
       mask) in the title.
    </p>
    <h2>Excluding unwished entries</h2>
    <p>
      The easyest way to define rules that hide entries of a feed is by using the
      <b>Exclude</b> action:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Select the entry which you want to exclude by <i>long pressing</i> it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click the <i>Exclude</i> action from the action bar.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>NOTE 1: Depending on your device type, this action can be found as icon
        or as option in the overflow menu.</i><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>NOTE 2: Long pressing an icon in the action bar reveals the action name.</i>
    </p>
