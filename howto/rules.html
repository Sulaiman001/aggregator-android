    <h1>Entry rules</h1>
    <p><strong>Aggregator</strong> uses user-defined entry rules to filter out the entries of a feed.</p>
<p>There are two types of rules: <strong>exclude rules</strong>, used to mark which entries should be hidden while aggregating a feed,
and <strong>include rules</strong>, used to cancel the effect of some exclude rules.</p>
<p>Every entry rule defines a <strong>mask</strong> used to match the entries for which the rule <strong>action</strong> is applied. The <code>%</code>
character is used to match zero, one or multiple characters, and can be used multiple times in a <strong>mask</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>%aggregator%</code> title mask will match every entry that contains <code>aggregator</code> in the title. While the <code>%
Vol % Ch %</code> title mask will match every entry that contains both <code>Vol</code> and <code>Ch</code> (in the same order as present in the
mask) in the title.</p>
<h2>Excluding unwished entries</h2>
<p>The easiest way to define rules that hide entries of a feed is by using the <strong>exclude</strong> action:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the entry which you want to exclude by <em>long pressing</em> it.</li>
<li>Click the <em>exclude</em> action from the action bar.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>NOTE: Depending on your device type, the <strong>exclude</strong> action can be found either as as an action icon or as an option in
the overflow menu.</em></p>
<p><em>HINT: Long pressing an icon in the action bar reveals the action name.</em></p>
<h2>Excluding all entries except the whished ones</h2>
<p>This is achieved by defining at least two rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>An <strong>exclude</strong> rule that hides every entry by using the following title mask: <code>%</code></li>
<li>One or more <strong>include</strong> rules that will cancel the effect of the <strong>exclude</strong> rule.</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules are preferably created from the <em>entry rules</em> activity, which can be opened by clicking the <strong>entry rules</strong>
option from the overflow menu.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: The <strong>entry rules</strong> activity lists all the rules of a feed, including the global ones, while also showing how
many entries are matched by a rule.</em></p>
